# ProjectRedExtended
Addition to Project:Red by MrTJP, some adds from BluePower, the aim is to add some features back from RedPower

Yea, im trying to add some RedPower Features to ProjectRed with the help of BluePower by QMunity. Feel free to help improving the mod.

FAQ:
Q: Why do you create the mod?
A: Because I think Project Red has some good features and BluePower too, why you shouldn't use them together?

Q: What are you going to add in the future?
A: More tube machines, Thermopile, crafting recipes and Alloy Furnace Recipes, Blulectric Alloy Furnace, probably a Blulectric Pulverizer ;) I'll see what I can do :)

Q: What mods do I need to use the mod/test it?
A: CodeChickenCore,CodeChickenLib,ForgeMultipart,ForgeRelocation,ForgeRelocationFMP,InventoryTweaks,MRTJPCore,NotEnoughItems,ProjectRedBase,ProjectRedCompat,ProjectRedFabrication,ProjectRedIntegration,ProjectRedLightning,ProjectRedMechanical,ProjectRedWorld,WAILA

Q: Do I need the Dev versions?
A: You need the dev version of ChickenBonesMods , the rest of the mods are working so far :)

Q: Why do you do what you do? xD
A: Because Eloraam isnt continuing RedPower for Minecraft, shes creating a new game, it looks very nice and im very exited to test it, but I think Redpower should have a Future on the Minecraft platform too.
